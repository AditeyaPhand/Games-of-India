<hl align=center>SPORTS IN INDIA</h1>

<h2><font color-white>Cricket
    The popularity of cricket in India is unparalleled compared to interest generated by a particular sport in
     any other country. Brazil and Argentina do come close in terms of a similar obsession with football, but 
     the sheer number of cricket followers in India tilts the balance eastwards.

    <h2> 

h3><font color=yellow>Football
     The most popular sport in the world, football remains an enigma in India. Famously called the 'sleeping 
     giant' of the footballing world by former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, football is primarily a spectator
      sport in India. While the ISL has garnered a hefty base of followers inIndia, it is the huge following of 
      European club tournaments which forms the roots of football's popularity in India.

<h2><font color=green>Kabaddi
    While different sports in India like badminton and hockey would have nabbed the third spot a few years
     back, kabaddi has returned to the center stage of Indian sports.
